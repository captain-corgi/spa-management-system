## User Prompts and System Actions (Chronological)

### CI/CD, Jenkins, and Pipeline Setup
- Created dedicated Jenkinsfiles for each backend and frontend service/app, with matrix builds, Docker, Trivy, and Kubernetes deployment.
- Added multi-environment support, credential usage, and email notifications.
- Documented pipeline folder structure and automation with Job DSL.
- Restructured `ci-cd` folder for clarity (separate `jenkins`, `github`, etc.), updated all READMEs.

### Database Configuration
- Defined PostgreSQL schemas for all domains and created migration scripts per domain.
- Set up connection pooling and Redis caching using GORM and go-redis.
- Implemented transaction management helpers for both Postgres and Redis.
- Automated migration execution in CI/CD and for local development via Makefile.
- Documented database setup, usage, and troubleshooting.

### Integration and Architecture Documentation
- Created `integration-strategy.md` covering service communication, frontend integration, testing, data contracts, and API gateway configuration.
- Added a comprehensive docs index (`README.md`), onboarding guide, troubleshooting guide, and ADR folder.
- Provided a PlantUML system architecture diagram (`system-architecture.puml`) for visual overview.

### Development Environment & Local Setup
- Added `docker-compose.yml` for local development (Postgres, Redis, backend/frontend with hot reload).
- Created sample data SQL scripts for database initialization.
- Provided `.env.example` with all environment variables documented.
- Wrote a detailed local development guide.
